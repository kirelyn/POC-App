# POC-App
POC app for COVID-19
The point of contact app our team designed consists of a MySql database, c# solution, and window forms. Whenever a patient has a confirmed case of COVID-19, the health care worker/reporter can type the infected students student id into the windows form. The application will then find any students who have classes, clubs, or any other meeting with said person. Along with other personal information like student id and email, each student is assigned a priority. If a student has come across/potentially come across a student who is infected, their priority increments. An email and a notification is sent notifying the student after the priority is greater than one.

We feel that this is an effective way to fix the problem as it could handle a large universities students and could be a lot more autonomous than other applications. We have decided to do a priority based system as if every student received a notification for a risk of exposure, they would get them quite often and it may not be helpful. There is a lot more room for expansion with the app that would be pretty simple to report other statistics and give other resources as well.
